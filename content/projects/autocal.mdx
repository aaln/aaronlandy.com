Autocal.ai is a tool designed to expedite the creation of calendar events through AI-driven prompts. Users input any specifics about a meeting—including details like the subject, location, time, and participants—and the system auto-generates a Google Calendar™ template link that can be immediately populated into a user's calendar.
