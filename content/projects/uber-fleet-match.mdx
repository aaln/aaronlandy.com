I worked at Uber in 2017 on the Fleets team and developed a platform designed to help vehicle owners manage their fleet of cars and drivers efficiently. It provides tools for tracking vehicle usage, maintenance schedules, and driver performance. The platform aims to streamline operations for fleet owners, ensuring that vehicles are always in optimal condition and drivers are performing at their best. Uber Fleet also offers analytics and reporting features, allowing owners to make data-driven decisions to improve their business operations.

I was part of the team that developed Uber Fleet Match, a networking tool within the Uber driver app. This tool connects vehicle owners with drivers looking for vehicles to drive on Uber. My role involved working closely with product managers and designers to understand the needs of both vehicle owners and drivers. I contributed to the development of the matching algorithm, ensuring that it efficiently paired drivers with suitable vehicles based on various criteria such as location, availability, and vehicle type. Additionally, I helped implement features that allowed users to communicate and negotiate terms directly within the app, making the process seamless and user-friendly. Our team conducted extensive testing and gathered user feedback to continuously improve the tool, ultimately enhancing the overall experience for both vehicle owners and drivers.
